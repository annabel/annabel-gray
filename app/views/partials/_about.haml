        Hi! I'm Annabel and this is my online portfolio.  I'm a front-end web developer with a mobile-first mentality.
        I believe in clean and semantic HTML and well-organized CSS and JavaScript. I enjoy collaborating with other people,
        <span class="stress">love</span> learning new skills, and never hesitate to tackle new technologies (I'm currently
        learning iOS development in my spare time).
