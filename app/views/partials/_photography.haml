        Before I started programming I did a bunch of photography. Blah blah greatest accomplishment was having one
        of my photographs being selected for an exhibition at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC. Also contribute work
        to Arthouse in Austin for the last few years. I'm currently in the process of transferring my work to this site, but
        for now you can view some of my photography
