quote: 'History is the business of identifying momentous events from the comfort of a high-back chair. With the benefit of time, the historian looks back and points to a date in the manner of a gray-haired field marshal pointing to a bend in a river on a map: There it was, he says. The turning point. The decisive factor. The fateful day that fundamentally altered all that was to follow.'

    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
    and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
    pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
    how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
    painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
    occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
